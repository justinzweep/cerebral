# Cerebral macOS App - Sprint Stories & Epics

## üéØ Epic Overview

### Epic 1: Document-Based App Foundation
**Goal**: Transform Cerebral into a native macOS document-based application with proper file management integration.

### Epic 2: Hybrid Vector Search Architecture  
**Goal**: Implement ObjectBox on-device vector storage and search while leveraging Python API for document processing and query embedding.

### Epic 3: Authentication & App Launch
**Goal**: Implement authentication gate where users must sign in/up via modal on first launch, then access the full app with subscription-based feature limitations.

### Epic 4: Enhanced PDF Integration
**Goal**: Implement native PDF viewing with intelligent highlighting and context navigation.

### Epic 5: Context-Aware AI Chat
**Goal**: Build intelligent chat system with precise document references and visual navigation.

## üèóÔ∏è Hybrid Architecture Approach

### Python API Integration
The rebuild maintains a strategic dependency on Python API for two critical operations:

1. **Document Chunking & Embedding**: Python API processes PDF documents and returns structured JSON with:
   - `document_id`: Unique identifier for the source document
   - `chunk_id`: Unique identifier for each text chunk
   - `text`: Extracted text content of the chunk
   - `bounding_boxes`: Coordinate information for visual highlighting
   - `embeddings`: Vector embeddings for semantic search

2. **Query Embedding**: Python API converts user queries into vector embeddings for search operations

### On-Device ObjectBox Storage
- All processed chunks stored locally in ObjectBox vector database
- Fast similarity search operations (<100ms response time)
- Privacy-focused: search operations never leave the device
- Offline capability: search works without internet connectivity

### Authentication & Launch Requirements
- **Mandatory Authentication**: All users must have an account to access any app functionality
- **Authentication Modal**: First-time users see sign up/in modal, then app launches normally
- **Subscription Tiers**: Three access levels (Trial, Subscription, Purchased) with different feature limits
- **Clerk Integration**: Native iOS authentication using Clerk SDK for user management
- **Trial Access**: New users automatically get trial access after authentication
- **In-App Limitations**: Feature limits enforced throughout normal app usage
- **Upgrade Flows**: Paywall appears when users hit trial limitations

### Benefits of Hybrid Approach
- **Processing Power**: Leverage specialized Python ML libraries for document processing
- **Privacy**: Search operations and data storage remain on-device
- **Performance**: Fast local search with optimized ObjectBox vector operations
- **Scalability**: Python API can be scaled independently for processing workloads
- **User Management**: Clerk handles authentication, user profiles, and subscription state

## üîê Authentication & Subscription Implementation Details

### Clerk iOS SDK Integration
Following the provided Clerk quickstart guide:

```swift
// App entry point with authentication gate
@main
struct CerebralApp: App {
    @State private var clerk = Clerk.shared
    
    var body: some Scene {
        DocumentGroup(newDocument: CerebralDocument()) { file in
            ZStack {
                if clerk.isLoaded {
                    if let user = clerk.user {
                        ContentView(document: file.$document)
                    } else {
                        SignUpOrSignInView()
                    }
                } else {
                    ProgressView("Loading...")
                }
            }
            .environment(clerk)
            .task {
                clerk.configure(publishableKey: "YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY")
