# UI/UX Improvements for Cerebral macOS App

## Executive Summary
This document outlines comprehensive UI/UX improvements for Cerebral, focusing on creating a modern, sleek, and minimalistic macOS application that follows Apple Human Interface Guidelines. The improvements are inspired by contemporary chat applications while maintaining the unique functionality of a PDF annotation and AI assistant tool.

## Overall Design Philosophy

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
- **Implement a true three-pane layout** with clear visual separation using subtle dividers and different background materials
- **Reduce visual noise** by using more whitespace and removing unnecessary borders
- **Create depth through materials** instead of heavy shadows (use Material.thin, Material.regular strategically)
- **Establish consistent visual rhythm** through a refined spacing system

## 1. Navigation & Structure Improvements âœ…

### Sidebar Refinements
**Current Issues:**
- Heavy visual weight with too many visual elements
- Inconsistent spacing and alignment
- Lack of clear visual hierarchy between folders and documents

**Improvements:**
```swift
// Enhanced sidebar with refined styling
- Use sidebar list style with improved row styling
- Implement collapsible sections with smooth animations
- Add subtle hover states with material backgrounds
- Use icon badges for document status (new, annotated, etc.)
- Implement smart grouping by date/type/folder with clear headers
```

### Document Row Styling
**Improvements:**
- **Refined typography hierarchy** with better contrast ratios
- **Subtle state indicators** (hover, selection, focus states)
- **Contextual actions** revealed on hover (quick actions like share, chat)
- **Smart metadata display** showing relevant info based on recency
- **Improved accessibility** with better color contrast and touch targets

### Search Enhancement
- **Scoped search** with filters (by date, type, annotation status)
- **Search result highlighting** with proper visual emphasis
- **Recent searches** dropdown with quick access
- **Keyboard navigation** throughout search results

## 2. PDF Viewer Improvements

### Modern PDF Interface
**Required features:**
- Text highlighting: when a user select text in the pdf a popup modal should appear with 3 colors. When the user selects a color the text should be higlighted, just as with the native mac pdf reader. It should look like the user use a marker over the text.

**Improvements:**
```swift
// Enhanced PDF viewer with modern styling
- Floating toolbar with material background and subtle shadow; should only appear when text is selected
- Status bar with elegant typography and proper spacing
```

### Annotation System
- **Color-coded annotation types** with consistent visual language
- **Annotation preview cards** on hover with smooth animations
- **Use PDFKit** whereever possible

## 3. Chat Interface Modernization

### Chat Layout Refinements
**Current Issues:**
- Basic message bubbles without proper visual hierarchy
- Inconsistent spacing between messages
- No visual indicators for message status

**Improvements:**
```swift
// Modern chat interface inspired by contemporary apps
- Refined message bubbles with subtle shadows and proper corner radius
- Improved message spacing with breathing room
- Typing indicators with elegant animations
- Smart message grouping by time/context
- Remove the document banner on top of the chat view
- Input fields should follow SwiftUI best practises and have a clean minimal design
```

### Chat Input Enhancement
- **Multi-line input** with auto-expanding height
- **Rich text formatting** options (bold, italic, code)
- **Attachment preview above the chat input field** for document context
    - This should replace the current functionality displaying the pdf banner on top of the chat view
    - The attached pdf(s) should be displayed as 'pills' and should be removeable
- **Send button animation** with proper state feedback
- **The ability to start a new clean chat session**

### AI Assistant Personality
- **Typing animation** with realistic timing
- **Response streaming** with smooth text appearance

## 4. Settings & Preferences

### Modern Settings Interface
**Current Issues:**
- Basic tab interface without visual polish
- Inconsistent form styling
- Poor visual hierarchy

**Improvements:**
```swift
// Settings with refined macOS styling
- Navigation sidebar instead of tabs for better organization
- Form groups with proper section headers and descriptions
- Inline validation with helpful error messages
- Preview areas for theme/appearance changes
- Better organization of related settings
```

### API Key Management
- **Secure input fields** with proper masking and validation
- **Connection status indicators** with real-time feedback
- **Usage monitoring** with visual progress indicators
- **Multiple API provider support** with clear switching interface

## 5. Design System Enhancements

### Color System Refinement
```swift
// Enhanced color palette following macOS design patterns
Colors {
    // Semantic colors with proper contrast ratios
    static let primaryText = Color(.labelColor)
    static let secondaryText = Color(.secondaryLabelColor)
    static let tertiaryText = Color(.tertiaryLabelColor)
    
    // Surface colors using proper materials
    static let primarySurface = Material.thick
    static let secondarySurface = Material.regular
    static let tertiarySurface = Material.thin
    
    // Accent colors with accessibility compliance
    static let accent = Color(.controlAccentColor)
    static let accentSecondary = Color(.controlAccentColor).opacity(0.8)
}
```

### Typography System
```swift
// Refined typography scale
Typography {
    // Better hierarchy with consistent line heights
    static let title1 = Font.largeTitle.weight(.bold).leading(.tight)
    static let title2 = Font.title.weight(.semibold).leading(.tight)
    static let headline = Font.headline.weight(.medium).leading(.snug)
    static let body = Font.body.leading(.relaxed)
    static let caption = Font.caption.weight(.medium).leading(.snug)
}
```

### Animation System
```swift
// Sophisticated animation library
Animation {
    static let interface = Animation.easeInOut(duration: 0.2)
    static let modal = Animation.spring(response: 0.4, dampingFraction: 0.8)
    static let microInteraction = Animation.easeOut(duration: 0.15)
    static let pageTransition = Animation.easeInOut(duration: 0.3)
}
```
